## Schedule

|   Lecture |  Topic |
|-----------|--------|
|  1  | Probability intro/review: Boolean algebra / logic / Venn diagram with events and probabilities, random variables, transformations of variables, probability distributions (pmf & cdf) for discrete random variables. Properties of a distribution: mean, median, mode, variance, entropy. Linearity of expectations. |  
|  2  | Well-known discrete distributions. Conditional probabilities (univariate). |
|  3  | Bayes' Theorem. Multivariate distributions (discrete): joint, marginal, conditional, covariance. (in)dependence. Variance of a sum.  
|  4  | Continuous random variables and their distributions (univariate); CDF vs PDF. Quantiles. Support. 
|  5  | Finding expected values and functions of expected values with continuous distributions. Multivariate continuous distributions as distributions over vectors. Covariance, correlation, etc. 
|  6  | Review of vectors and linear algebra. Multivariate Gaussian distribution.
|  7  | Mixtures of (univariate/multivariate) Gaussians. View of data as coming from a probability distribution. Setting the stage for supervised learning: response variables, predictors, conditioning on predictors, and more.
|  8  | Various topics related to what we've done in the course; an intro to maximum likelihood estimation.
